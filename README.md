# Features

- Collectable red orb  
- Transform arena into different layouts on collecting red orb  
- 15 layouts to randomly select
- Each layout specifies an area that the red orb can spawn so on arena transform the red orb will randomly choose from the specified area. This is shown at the end of the editor script video below.
# Editor Script
I created an editor script that allows me to easily create additional arena layouts for the game. The script adds functionality to the editor that allows me to click a button to load and save layouts which are then pulled during runtime to transform the arena. This script is shown in the below video.
