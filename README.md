# Features
- Walls  
- Floor 
- 8-directional movement  
- Jump
- score  
- Collectable red orb  
- Transform arena into different layouts on collecting red orb  
- 15 layouts to randomly select
- Each layout specifies an area that the red orb can spawn so on arena transform the red orb will randomly choose from the specified area.
# Editor Script
I created an editor script that allows me to easily create additional arena layouts for the game. The script adds functionality to the editor that allows me to click a button to load and save layouts which are then pulled during runtime to transform the arena.
